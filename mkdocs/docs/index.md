# Integrations SDK

Lean batteries-included integrations built to accelerate agent development.

## Highlights
- Providers auto-configure from env vars and expose common async actions.
- A shared `Integrations` container keeps lookup, scope, and overrides simple.
- Optional auth subsystem wires auth flows (like OAuth2) to provider settings.
- Async first!
